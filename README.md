# EvoHex

EvoHex is a Hexagonal-grid-based plant life evolution simulator developed in Unity. It is currently in a very early stage of development, so consider it a fun experiment for now. Contributions are welcome, as long as they are approved by the author.

## Description

This project aims to simulate evolution of plant life on a hexagonal grid. The main goal is to see how different types of plants will evolve over time, depending on the environment they are in. Currently, the simulator only has basic features and limited interactivity, but it will be updated and improved in the future.
